		! Note that 1-phase loads have a voltage rating = to actual voltage across terminals
		! This could be either 2.4kV for Wye connectoin or 4.16 kV for Delta or Line-Line connection.
		! 3-phase loads are rated Line-Line (as are 2-phase loads, but there are none in this case).
		! Only the balanced 3-phase loads are declared as 3-phase; unbalanced 3-phase loads are declared
